# Validating-Age-Range
This JavaScript function, "ageValide", takes an age as input and evaluates whether it falls within the range of 5 to 60 years. If the age is within this range, it returns "age valide"; otherwise, it returns "age non valide". This function effectively checks if an age is within a specified valid range.
